- <b><ins>08.2024 - present:</ins></b> Research Assistant in Computer Vision and
  Geometry Group, ETH Zürich
  - Research on generalizable sparse view 3D Gaussian splatting for 3D
    reconstruction.
  - I am currently working on generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting for scene
    reconstruction. As novel view synthesis objective through regular
    photogrammetric loss is not suitable for surface reconstruction, I am
    working on adapting existing sparse view generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting
    methods to surface reconstruction.

- <b><ins>03.2024 - 06.2024:</ins></b> Graduate Research Student in Computer
  Vision Lab, ETH Zürich
  - Research on learned 3D Gaussian splatting representation compression.
  - Worked on 3D Gaussian splatting compression through the literature on
    learned image compression. Representing a scene with 3D Gaussian splatting
    requires a large number of Gaussian primitives, from hundreds of thousands
    to several millions, resulting in high storage complexity. My projects
    focused on direct adoption of learned image compression networks for
    Gaussian splatting compression through a short finetuning stage.

- <b><ins>06.2020 - 09.2022:</ins></b> Undergraduate Research Assistant in KUIS
  AI Lab, Koç University
  - Research on learned image/video compression. Work accepted in
    [ICIP 2022](https://2022.ieeeicip.org/).
  - Worked on image and video compression using recurrent and fully
    convolutional variational auto-encoders. My projects included our work on
    the design of a novel bidirectional frame compression network and several
    implementation of recent works in the literature using PyTorch machine
    learning framework.
  - Supervisor: [Professor A. Murat Tekalp](http://home.ku.edu.tr/~mtekalp/)
  - Research interests of Professor Tekalp captures a wide range of image/video
    processing applications including image/video super resolution, compression
    and restoration. With his vast research experience, Professor Tekalp helped
    me broaden my knowledge on above mentioned tasks and guided me through our
    research.

- <b><ins>06.2021 - 09.2021:</ins></b> Summer Research Assistant in KUIS AI Lab,
  Koç University
  - Studied style transfer and image manipulation with generative adversarial
    networks.
  - Worked on implementation of “Swapping Autoencoder for Deep Image
    Manipulation” by [Park et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00653) and
    presented the work together with a demo.
  - Supervisor: [Professor Aykut Erdem](https://aykuterdem.github.io/)
  - Professor Erdem conducts research on a diverse set of topics, ranging from
    image editing to visual saliency estimation, and to multimodal learning for
    integrated vision and language.
