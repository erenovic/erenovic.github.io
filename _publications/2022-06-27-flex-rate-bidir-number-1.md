This paper presents improvements and novel additions to our recent work on
end-to-end optimized hierarchical bidirectional video compression
[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09529) to further advance the stateof-the-art in
learned video compression. As an improvement, we combine motion estimation and
prediction modules and compress refined residual motion vectors for improved
rate-distortion performance. As novel addition, we adapted the gain unit
proposed for image compression to flexible-rate video compression in two ways:
first, the gain unit enables a single encoder model to operate at multiple
rate-distortion operating points; second, we exploit the gain unit to control
bit allocation among intra-coded vs. bi-directionally coded frames by fine
tuning corresponding models for truly flexiblerate learned video coding.
Experimental results demonstrate that we obtain state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance exceeding those of all prior art in learned video coding.
