Video content has been becoming more prevalent in the last decade by capturing
80% of the online data. As this is the case, more efficient video compression
methods are helpful to provide a better service for people who stream online
video content with a limited bandwidth. For that reason, our aim is to develop a
learned bidirectional video compression framework that achieves superior or
competitive rate-distortion performance compared to other works in the
literature of video compression. To achieve the desired results, we employ
additional modules such as bidirectional motion prediction, motion refinement,
learned frame fusion and achieve flexible bitrate using a single model with
learned quantization parameters. Testing our network on UVG dataset, a common
benchmark, we achieve competitive or superior results at high bitrates when we
compare our results with other learned video compression networks such as DVC
[1](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Lu_DVC_An_End-To-End_Deep_Video_Compression_Framework_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf),
Scale-Space Flow
[2](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Agustsson_Scale-Space_Flow_for_End-to-End_Optimized_Video_Compression_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf),
RLVC [3](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9288876), and LHBDC
[4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09529) in terms of PSNR and MS-SSIM scores. On
the other hand, the model achieves slightly worse rate-distortion performance at
low bitrates compared to LHBDC [4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09529) and the
traditional SVT-HEVC codec at very slow preset in terms of PSNR and MS-SSIM. In
the following report, further details of the proposed network are provided
extensively with visual results that demonstrate the effect of main modules.

I have prepared for my BSc thesis.
