* Assisted to the teaching for the ”Game Theory & Strategy” lectures of [Professor Levent Koçkesen](https://sites.google.com/view/lkockesen/home). I conducted problem sessions for over
80 students weekly and arranged office hours.

Course Overview
======
This course aims to introduce you to the basic tools and applications
of game theory. Game theory provides a way of formally modeling and analyzing
situations where at least two parties (e.g. individuals, firms, countries…) interact in a
strategic manner. Having started as a field of mathematics, game theory is now used
extensively in economics, and has also found many applications in political science,
sociology, biology and law. Topics to be covered include models of games in extensive
and strategic form, equilibria with randomization, repeated games, games with imperfect
and incomplete information, signaling and beliefs, and other economic applications of
these models.
