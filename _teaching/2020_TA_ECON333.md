# Course Overview

This course aims to introduce you to the basic tools and applications of game
theory. Game theory provides a way of formally modeling and analyzing situations
where at least two parties (e.g. individuals, firms, countries…) interact in a
strategic manner. Having started as a field of mathematics, game theory is now
used extensively in economics, and has also found many applications in political
science, sociology, biology and law. Topics to be covered include models of
games in extensive and strategic form, equilibria with randomization, repeated
games, games with imperfect and incomplete information, signaling and beliefs,
and other economic applications of these models.
