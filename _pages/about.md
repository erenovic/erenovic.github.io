Hello! I’m Eren Çetin, a passionate Master’s student at ETH Zürich, specializing
in signal processing and machine learning. I am particularly interested in 3D
vision and 3D reconstruction. For that purpose, I worked on multiple projects
including generalizable 3D reconstruction from sparse views and also compression
of representations such as for Gaussian Splatting.

My academic journey began at Koç University, where I pursued a double major in
Electrical & Electronics Engineering and Economics, blending the technical
intricacies of engineering with the analytical mindset of economics. My
professional interests are in `3d vision`, `3d reconstruction`,
`machine learning`, `computer vision`, and `image/video processing`.

For most of my research and education, I work with frameworks, languages and
tools such as `Python`, `PyTorch`, `MATLAB`, `C/C++`, `CUDA Programming`.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
