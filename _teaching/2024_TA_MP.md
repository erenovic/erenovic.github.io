  course. The course involves a wide-range of Computer Vision applications and
  is offered to a diverse group of students at ETH Zurich.

# Course Overview

Recent developments in neural networks (aka “deep learning”) have drastically
advanced the performance of machine perception systems in a variety of areas
including computer vision, robotics, and human shape modeling This course is a
deep dive into deep learning algorithms and architectures with applications to a
variety of perceptual and generative tasks.
