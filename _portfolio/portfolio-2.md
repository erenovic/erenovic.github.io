Recent advancements, particularly in novel view synthesis, catalyzed the pursuit
of 3D reconstruction using neural implicit representations. However, per-scene
optimized models do not emerge as feasible options in many real-life
applications and suggest the development of generalizable 3D reconstruction
models. In this paper, we present MatchSDF, a novel 3D reconstruction model that
uses pairwise cosine similarity for views provided and additional geometry
encoding features such as groupwise variance to improve geometric cues. In
addition, MatchSDF benefits from cross-point correlation by incorporating Ray
Transformer into generic SDF networks. MatchSDF is capable of performing novel
view synthesis by using the recent idea of color blending to improve the
appearance of views. On the DTU benchmark, MatchSDF achieves comparable and
slightly better results against SparseNeuS while being reference-view agnostic
and not limited by volumetric features.

For further information, please refer to the
[report](/files/matchsdf/Course-Project-MatchSDF.pdf) we have prepared for the
course project.
